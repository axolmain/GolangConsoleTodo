# Overview

This is a very basic GoLang to-do list creator that runs in your terminal when run locally. It's not designed to be transferred to a web application or use as a long term application, it's mostly designed to be used as a single project which contains all major beginner GoLang functions and syntax.

Coming from a C#/Python background I wanted to just create a simple project to learn the basics of Golang for later knowledge growth.

# Development Environment

I used VS Code as my code editor, along with the Go extension. To actually run the project, I downloaded GoLang 21.1 for ARM (the architecture doesn't make a diffference for reproducing this project) on my device. 

All of these software are the most up-to-date versions of them.
